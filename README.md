# AKX_HNRNPU_manuscript

This repository includes codes and pipelines for figures and tables in the manuscript: "Modular protein-RNA associations reveal a requirement for HNRNPU in long-range Polycomb recruitment by the lncRNAs *Airn*, *Kcnq1ot1*, and *Xist*"

Codes are organized by Figure number in each folder named accordingly. A _readme.docx file states the full pipeline for plotting each panels in that figure and also a brief description of the purpose of each code file.

NCBI GEO accession numbers for the sequencing data associated with this study are: GSE299584 [RNA-Seq]; GSE299585 [RIP-Seq];GSE299587 [ChIP-Seq].
